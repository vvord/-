## Lesson 3 Arotos (Ploughing) (a)
#### Translation
Dicaeopolis is driving his oxen, these oxen dragging the plough, and Xanthias sowing the seed. But look, these oxen stay in one place and no longer drag the plough. Dicaeopolis calls his oxen and says, "hurry up, o oxen, don't stop." And these oxen are still not moving. So Dicaeopolis says, "why are you not moving, o oxen?" and he look toward the plough. And look, a stone is obstructing it. So Dicaeopolis takes the stone but can not lift it. It is large. So he calls his slave, "come here," he says, "and help [me]. A large stone is obstructing the plough, and these oxen are stopped."

So Xanthias slowly approaches but does not help. He looks toward the stone, "the stone is large, o master," and he says, "look, it is not possible to lift it." Dicaeopolis, "don't be lazy," he says, "but help [me]. For it is possible to lift the stone." Together the master and the slave lift the stone and carry it out of the field.

While they are lifting it, Xanthias stumbles and he drops the stone. The stone falls toward Dicaeopolis' foot. Because of this, Dicaeopolis groans, "O Zeus," and he says, "oh, my poor foot. Take the stone, o you fool, and lift it and don't be so clumsy." And Xanthias, "why are you so hard, o master?" he says, "I am not responsible [for it].The stone is large, and it is not possible to carry it." Dicaeopolis, "don't talk nonsense, you rogue, but lift the stone and throw [it] out of the field." So again they lift the stone and with difficulty they throw it out of the field. Thereafter Dicaeopolis drive these oxen, and these oxen no longer stop but drag the plough.

He carries the dinner to his father, when he steps in the field, he calls and speaks to his father, "come here, o father. Look, I carry / bring the dinner. Don't work any longer but sit [down] and eat."

And the father leaves the plough and calls the slave. So they sit [down] together and eat. After the dinner Dicaeopolis, "Stay, o son," he says, "and help [me]. Carry the seed and sow. And you, o Xanthias, dig the stones [out] and carry [them] out of the field. The stone is [too] many and it is scarcely possilbe to plow."  And Xanthias, "but it is not possible to carry out so many stones." And Dicaeopolis ,"don't talk nonsense, O Xanthias, but [begin to] work." So the father and his son and his slave works. And finally the sun sets, and these men no longer work but loose these oxen, and leave the plough in the field, and slowly walk toward the house.

### The oxen
#### Translation
The master and the slave walk toward the field. The slave carries the plough, and the master drives the oxen. When they approach the field, the oxen no longer move. So the master shouts [at them], "don't stop, o oxen," and he says, "but hurry into the field." And the oxen still rest. So the master calls the slave, "come here, O Xanthias," he says, "help [me]. the oxen are not moving and it is not possible to drive them into the field." So the slave approaches, "but it is possible," and he says, "look," and he goads the oxen. And they no longer rest but hasten into the field.

## Lesson 4 Pros tei krenei (To the spring) (a)
#### Translation
The next day when the Sun is (first) rising, the wife calls her husband, "get up, o man", and says, "(for) the Sun is rising, and the slave is already leading these oxen to the field, (and) I and our daughter have in mind to walk to the spring/fountain. Get up, for it is right time to walk to the field." But Dicaeopolis is very tired and he does not wish to get up. So he says, "Don't be so hard, o woman, I'm very tired and I wish to sleep." His wife, "but it is not possible to be still sleeping," she says, "it is time to work. Get up, o man."
So (on the one hand) Dicaeopolis gets up with difficulty and walks toward the field, (on the other hand,) Myrrihine nad Melissa walk toward the spring/fountain (Melissa is [the] daughter, a beautiful girl.) The mother and the daughter both walk slowly, (they are) carrying water jars. (And) large are the water jars, so that it is not possible to hurry.
When they approach the spring, look, other women are already there and lifting the water jars. So Myrrhine calls these women, "greetings, o dear friends," she says, "are you filling these jars already?" And they answer, "and greetings to you, yes, we are already filling these jars, (for) early in the day we are here. But come here quickly and listen, a messenger has come from the city, and he says that the Athenians is celebrating the festival of Dionysus. So we intend to walk to the city, for we wish to watch the dances and the contests and the plays. And do you wish to watch the festival?
